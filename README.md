# Data from Master Thesis "Integrating Algorithm Selection and Configuration: A Proof of Concept for the Modular CMA-ES"

Data from experiments can be found [on surfdrive](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/dRS0L5NE4XarYYo). 
To recreate the figures form the thesis, the Jupyter Notebook in the 'Notebooks' folder can be used. Simply download the required data, change the data-location in the notebook, and run the required cells.

This repository also contains the source code used to run the experiments. 
The [ModEA](https://github.com/sjvrijn/ModEA) and [COCO](https://github.com/numbbo/coco) packages need to be installed seperately to run this code.
